# Portfolio-Website
Django, HTML, CSS
I've started making Portfolio website using Django, HTML, and CSS.
Some key features will be: User login/ Regustration. User Account; Adding Skills, Editing Profile. A search bar, and pop up messages. Welcoming emails and password reset. This website will be deployed in Heroku.

Basically, users could sign up for my portfolio website and received emails if I added new projects. In other words, the user will keep up with my professional career by changes I make on this website.

The expected day of completion will be by December 19, 2022. I will accomplish this by working on this website 1-2 hours everyday during the school semester. It's going to be hard, but I'm determined to accomplish this.
